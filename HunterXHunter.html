        <h1>Main Plot Summary-</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Spoiler Warning!</p>
        <p>Hunter X Hunter is about how a boy from Whale Island called Gon Freecs, goes on a journey to become a Hunter. His father, Ging became a Hunter and left Gon 
            with Ging's cousin/sister-in-law, Mito (depends on which version of the anime you watch, there's one from 1999 and 2011). I'm just going to go with Mito being
            Ging's cousin but that doesn't really matter because Mito in Gon's eyes is his mum. 
        </p>
        <p>So Gon sets out on his journey to take the Hunter exam and leaves Whale Island and Mito, to become a Hunter like his father, Ging with the hopes of knowing why his father left
            him when he was 2 years old.
        </p>
        <h2>Hunter Exam</h2>
        <p>
            On the way to the place where the Hunter Exam is held, Gon undergoes a trial of sorts on the ship heading there, and makes friends with: Kurapika, the last member of the Kurta
            Clan (the Kurta Clan are known for their scarlet eyes, Kurapika's whole clan was massacred with every single scarlet eye stolen by the Phantom Troupe (also know as the Spiders), criminal organisation who we get 
            to know later) and Leorio (wants to become a Hunter for money, with enough to become a doctor/physician who can give free treatment to the poor).
        </p>
        <p>So Gon, Kurapika and Leorio set out on their journey to take the Hunter exam. </p>
        <p>I'm not going to go into too much detail here. I'll probably add more detail when I do a rewatch of HxH or reread the manga again but just know that:
            <ul>
                <li>Gon becomes close friends with Killua, the heir to the Zoldyck family who are known to be elite assassins due to how they are both around the same age, 11-12 years old. </li>
                <li>Gon has a debt to settle with Hisoka (he let Gon pass one of the stages of the Hunter exam by giving him a badge needed to pass: Gon didn't feel like he earnt it) </li>
                <li>Hisoka let Kurapika win a fight after telling Kurapika about some clues about the Phantom Troupe</li>
                <li>Gon, Kurapika and Leorio all become Hunters (though Gon is relunctant to accept his win because of Hisoka)</li>
                <li>Killua at the final stage of the Hunter exam, faces his elder brother, Illumi who was in disguise the whole time. Illumi is both (1) under orders from their father to bring Killua home and stay an assassin. 
                    (2) Illumi's own reasons to want to control Killua
                <ul>
                    <li>Illumi manipulated Killua into thinking that if Killua stayed with Gon, he would eventually kill Gon with Killua's only purpose in life to be killing.</li>
                    <li>Killua gives up on becoming a Hunter, killing one of the exam participants and runs back home because of Illumi's manipulation.</li>
                </ul> </li>
                <li>Hisoka, Illumi become Hunters without too much trouble (reason revealed later! Nen!)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
